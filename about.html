      shtfy is a URL-shortifier run by 
      <a href="http://aykit.org/sites/siteindex_en">
        aykit.
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We at aykit hate data retention and love open-source. shtfy is keeping storing data to a minimum:
      <dl>
        <dt>
          All URLs shortified
        </dt>
        <dd>
          For shtfy to work correctly, we need to save every URL that has been shortified and it's shortified version.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Hits
        </dt>
        <dd>
          We save how often a shortified URL has been visited. Note that we only save the amount of hits, nothing else.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Piwik visit tracking - Anonymised visits
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Knowing how many people visit our service is always good for morale. However, we do our best to track as little as possible: We save IPs hitting the main page (ay.vc) and this page (about.html) with the last digits anonymised (192.168.0.xxx). Additionally, we respect your Browser's 
          <a href="http://donottrack.us">
            Do-Not-Track 
          </a>
          setting. If you still don't trust us, we recommend usage of
          <a href="http://www.ghostery.com">
            Ghostery
          </a>
          or 
          <a href="http://alternativeto.net/software/ghostery/">
            similar software.
